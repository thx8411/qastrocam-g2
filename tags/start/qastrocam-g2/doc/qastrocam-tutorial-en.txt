Yes, the translation is not good, but the french documentation is not
good too (it is for an old version). It is in my TODO list.
Then here it is a brief tutorial :

0) general things

   Qastrocam captures a frame and throws it through a list of
   modules that process it sequentially:
   e.g.: capture->Swap rightLeft->center and crop->stack?
   It can also control some telescopes to do guiding

1) available options

By running qastrocam without argument you are given a brief list of options.
Here  is a short explanation:

-db Display the images from the camera.

-h  Display a histogram of the captured frames and some info to help
    the focusing (higher is the focus line, sharper (=in focus) the image
    should be)
    can be enable at runtime.

-M Enable the swap module, this will allow you to swap up/down, left/right
-dM Display the images after mirror transformation.
    can be enable at runtime.

-a  Stack frames
-da Display stacked frames
    can be enable at runtime.

-m  Special stacking system: This keeps the max of each pixel, this can be used to see the rotation of the stars in the sky
    when the cam is on a fixed mount.
-dm Display the images stacked with the "Max method"
    can be enable at runtime.

-c  Align frames (useful for stacking if your mount is not
    good (or if you don't have an equatorial mount))
    The image can also be cropped after centering
    (useful when your target is small)
-dc Display the centered/cropped images
    can be enable at runtime.

-dv <deviceName>  Set the V4L device name.
    default is /dev/video0.
-pc <port> IO port of the // port (in Hex).
    default is 378 (=LPT1) (use 278 for LPT2).
-t <type> Select the telescope type,
   type 'help' will give the list of available telescopes
-dt <deviceName> Set the telescope's device name.
    default is /dev/ttyS0.

2) samples:

   To stack images and display only the stacked images:
   $ qastrocam -s -ds 

   To stack images after realignment and display the frames after each
   transformation.
   $ qastrocam -db -c -dc -s -ds 

PS: checks and fixes to my English spelling are welcome.
