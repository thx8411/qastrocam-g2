---------------------- HOWTO -----------------------

    The hardware modem control lines can be monitored or modified by
    the `ioctl(2)` system call.  A set of comparable `tc*` calls
    apparentlty do not exist.  The form of this call is:

       int ioctl( `fd`, COMMAND, (int *)flags );

    The bit pattern of `flags` refer to the following control lines:
       TIOCM_LE      Line enable
       TIOCM_DTR     Data Terminal Ready
       TIOCM_RTS     Request to send
       TIOCM_ST      Secondary transmit
       TIOCM_SR      Secondary receive
       TIOCM_CTS     Clear to send
       TIOCM_CAR     Carrier detect
       TIOCM_RNG     Ring
       TIOCM_DSR     Data set ready

    The COMMANDS and their action are:
       TIOCMBIS  turn on control lines depending upon which bits
                 are set in `flags`.
       TIOCMBIC  turn off control lines depending upon which bits
                 are set in `flags`.
       TIOCMGET  the appropiate bits are set in `flags` according
                 to the current status 
       TIOCMSET  the state of the UART is changed according to which
                 bits are set/unset in `flags`

Read my `serial_suite.tgz`.  This is a collection of blurbs about the
care and feeding of the serial ports and some simple programs.  There is
a file demonstrating how the lock files should be programmed. There
is a simple getty, a dialer for ppp connections and some other misc
programs.
